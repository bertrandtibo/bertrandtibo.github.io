  abstract = {Non-motile active matter exhibits a wide range of non-equilibrium collective phenomena yet examples are crucially lacking in the literature. We present a microscopic model inspired by the bacteria Neisseria Meningitidis in which diffusive agents feel intermittent attractive forces. Through a formal coarse-graining procedure, we show that this truly scalar model of active matter exhibits the time-reversal-symmetry breaking terms defining the Active Model B+ class. In particular, we confirm the presence of microphase separation by solving the kinetic equations numerically. We show that the switching rate controlling the interactions provides a regulation mechanism tuning the typical cluster size, e.g. in populations of bacteria interacting via type IV pili. },

  abstract = {A positive rate of entropy production at steady state is a distinctive feature of truly non-equilibrium processes. Exact results, while being often limited to simple models, offer a unique opportunity to explore the thermodynamics features of these processes in full detail. Here we derive analytical results for the steady-state rate of entropy production in single particle systems driven away from equilibrium by a fluctuating external potential of arbitrary shapes. Subsequently, we provide exact results for a diffusive particle in a harmonic trap whose potential stiffness varies in time according to both discrete and continuous Markov processes. In particular, studying the case of a fully intermittent potential allows us to introduce an effective model of stochastic resetting for which it is possible to obtain finite non-negative entropy production. Altogether, this work lays the foundation for a non-equilibrium thermodynamic theory of fluctuating potentials, with immediate applications to stochastic resetting processes, fluctuations in optical traps and fluctuating interactions in living systems.},

Understanding this seemingly contradictory experimental observation, which occurs irrespective of whether the tissue is in the liquid or solid states, is not only crucial to our understanding of diverse biological processes, but is also of fundamental interest to soft matter and many-body physics. Here, we resolve this cellular to tissue level disconnect in the small fluctuation regime by using analytical theories based on hydrodynamic descriptions of confluent tissues, in both liquid and solid states. Specifically, we show that a collection of microscopic constituents with no inherently nematic extensile forces can exhibit active extensile nematic behavior when subject to polar fluctuating forces. We further support our findings by performing cell level simulations of minimal models of confluent tissues. [This article was selected as an Editor's Suggestion and was featured in Physics.]},

  abstract = {Characterizing the mechanical properties of tissues is key for the understanding of fundamental biological processes such as morphogenesis or tumor progression. In particular, the intercellular adhesion forces, mediated by transmembrane proteins like cadherins, are expected to control the topology and viscoelastic behavior of tissues under mechanical stress. In order to understand the influence of adhesion in tissues, we use biomimetic emulsions in which droplets mimic cells and adhere to each other through specific bonds. Here, we tune both the binding energy of the adhesive inter-droplets contacts as well as the fraction of contacts that are adhesive, thereby defining a so-called adhesiveness. Our experimental results show that adhesion prevents the emergence of local order in emulsions even at high packing fractions by preventing energetically costly droplet rearrangements. By studying the deformation of droplets within packings with different average adhesiveness values, we reveal the existence of a threshold value of adhesiveness above which all droplets in a packing are deformed as adhesive ones irrespective of their local adhesive properties. We show that this critical adhesiveness coincides with the threshold for percolation of adhesive structures throughout the tissue. From a biological point of view, this indicates that only a fraction of adhesive cells would be sufficient to tune the global mechanical properties of a tissue, which would be critical during processes such as morphogenesis.},

While cell-cell interactions are clearly key determinants of collective cell migration -- in addition to individual cells self-propulsion -- the physical mechanisms that control the emergence of cell clustering and collective cell migration are still poorly understood. In particular, observations have shown that binary cell-cell collisions generally lead to anti-alignement of cell polarities and separation of pairs -- a process called contact inhibition of locomotion (CIL), which is expected to disfavor the formation of large scale cell clusters with coherent motion. Here, we adopt a joint experimental and theoretical approach to determine the large scale dynamics of cell assemblies from elementary pairwise cell-cell interaction rules. We quantify experimentally binary cell-cell interactions and show that they can be captured by a minimal equilibrium-like pairwise asymmetric aligning interaction potential that reproduces the CIL phenomenology. We identify its symmetry class, build the corresponding active hydrodynamic theory and show on general grounds that such asymmetric aligning interaction destroys large scale clustering and ordering, leading instead to a liquid-like microphase of cell clusters of finite size and short lived polarity, or to a fully dispersed isotropic phase. Finally, this shows that CIL-like asymmetric interactions in cellular systems -- or general active systems -- control cluster sizes and polarity, and can prevent large scale coarsening and long range polarity, except in the singular regime of dense confluent systems.},

Inspired by binary reaction kinetics-like rules, we model systems of interacting agents activated upon pairwise contact. Using Poisson representations, our model is amenable to an exact nonlinear stochastic differential equation. We derive analytically its hydrodynamic limit, which turns out to be a nonlinear diffusion equation of porous medium type valid even far from steady state. We obtain exact self-similar solutions with subdiffusive scaling and compact support. The nonequilibrium steady state of our model in the dense phase displays hyperuniformity which we are able to predict from our analytical approach. We reinterpret hyperuniformity as stemming from correlations in particles displacements induced by the conservation of center of mass. Although quite simplistic, this model could in principle be realized experimentally at different scales by active particles systems.},

We find that the average contact number and packing fraction at jamming onset are similar (with relative deviations <0.5%) for MS packings generated via compression and shear. In contrast, the average stress anisotropy ⟨Σ̂ xy⟩=0 for MS packings generated via isotropic compression, whereas ⟨Σ̂ xy⟩>0 for MS packings generated via simple shear. To investigate the difference in the stress state of MS packings, we develop packing-generation protocols to first unjam the MS packings, remove the frictional contacts, and then rejam them. Using these protocols, we are able to obtain rejammed packings with nearly identical particle positions and stress anisotropy distributions compared to the original jammed packings. However, we find that when we directly compare the original jammed packings and rejammed ones, there are finite stress anisotropy deviations ΔΣ̂ xy. The deviations are smaller than the stress anisotropy fluctuations obtained by enumerating the force solutions within the null space of the contact networks generated via the DEM simulations. These results emphasize that even though the compression and shear jamming protocols generate packings with the same contact networks, there can be residual differences in the normal and tangential forces at each contact, and thus differences in the stress anisotropy. },

  abstract = {We employ numerical simulations to study active transistor-like switches made from two-dimensional (2D) granular crystals containing two types of grains with the same size but different masses. We tune the mass contrast and arrangement of the grains to maximize the width of the frequency band gap in the device. The input signal is applied to a single grain on one side of the device, and the output signal is measured from another grain on the other side of the device. Changing the size of one or many grains tunes the pressure, which controls the vibrational response of the device. Switching between the on and off states is achieved using two mechanisms: (1) pressure-induced switching where the interparticle contact network is the same in the on and off states and (2) switching through contact breaking. In general, the performance of the acoustic switch, as captured by the gain ratio and switching time between the on and off states, is better for pressure-induced switching. We show that in these acoustic switches the gain ratio between the on and off states can be larger than 104 and the switching time (multiplied by the driving frequency) is comparable to that obtained recently for sonic crystals and less than that for photonic transistor-like switches. Since the self-assembly of grains with different masses into 2D granular crystals is challenging, we describe simulations of circular grains with small circular knobs placed symmetrically around the perimeter mixed with circular grains without knobs. Using umbrella sampling techniques, we show that grains with six knobs most efficiently form the hexagonal crystals that yield the largest frequency band gap. Using the simulation results, we estimate the time required for vibration experiments to generate granular crystals of millimeter-sized steel beads with maximal band gaps.},

We focus on two protocols for generating MS packings at jamming onset: (1) isotropic compression and (2) applied simple or pure shear strain γ at fixed packing fraction ϕ. MS packings of frictionless disks occur as geometric families (i.e., quasiparabolic segments with positive curvature) in the ϕ−γ plane. MS packings from protocol 1 populate parabolic segments with both signs of the slope, dϕ/dγ>0 and dϕ/dγ<0. In contrast, MS packings from protocol 2 populate segments with dϕ/dγ<0 only. For both simple and pure shear, we derive a relationship between the stress anisotropy and local dilatancy dϕ/dγ obeyed by MS packings along geometrical families. We show that for MS packings prepared using isotropic compression, the stress anisotropy distribution is Gaussian centered at zero with a standard deviation that decreases with increasing system size. For shear jammed MS packings, the stress anisotropy distribution is a convolution of Weibull distributions that depend on strain, which has a nonzero average and standard deviation in the large-system limit. We also develop a framework to calculate the stress anisotropy distribution for packings generated via protocol 2 in terms of the stress anisotropy distribution for packings generated via protocol 1.},

In contrast, numerous prior studies characterized the structural and mechanical properties of MS packings of frictionless spherical particles at zero temperature. Packings of disks with purely repulsive contact interactions possess two main types of nonlinearities, one from the form of the interaction potential (e.g., either linear or Hertzian spring interactions) and one from the breaking (or forming) of interparticle contacts. To identify the temperature regime at which the contact-breaking nonlinearities begin to contribute, we first calculated the minimum temperatures Tcb required to break a single contact in the MS packing for both single- and multiple-eigenmode perturbations of the T=0 MS packing. We find that the temperature required to break a single contact for equal velocity-amplitude perturbations involving all eigenmodes approaches the minimum value obtained for a perturbation in the direction connecting disk pairs with the smallest overlap. We then studied deviations in the constant volume specific heat ¯¯¯CV and deviations of the average disk positions Δr from their T=0 values in the temperature regime T¯¯¯CV<T<Tr, where Tr is the temperature beyond which the system samples the basin of a new MS packing. We find that the deviation in the specific heat per particle Δ¯¯¯C0V/¯¯¯C0V relative to the zero-temperature value ¯¯¯C0V can grow rapidly above Tcb; however, the deviation Δ¯¯¯C0V/¯¯¯C0V decreases as N−1 with increasing system size. To characterize the relative strength of contact-breaking versus form nonlinearities, we measured the ratio of the average position deviations Δrss/Δrds for single- and double-sided linear and nonlinear spring interactions. We find that Δrss/Δrds>100 for linear spring interactions is independent of system size. This result emphasizes that contact-breaking nonlinearities are dominant over form nonlinearities in the low-temperature range Tcb<T<Tr for model jammed systems.},

We use the model and the experiments to study the complex internal dynamics of swelling and drying, and to highlight the fundamentally transient nature of these strikingly different processes.

  abstract = {We propose a “phase diagram” for particulate systems with purely repulsive contact forces, such as granular media and colloids. We characterize two classes of behavior as a function of the input kinetic energy per degree of freedom T0 and packing fraction deviation from jamming onset Δϕ=ϕ−ϕJ using simulations of frictionless disks. Isocoordinated solids (ICS) exist above jamming; they possess an average contact number equal to the isostatic value ziso. ICS display “strict” harmonic response, where the density of vibrational modes from the Fourier transform of the velocity autocorrelation function is a set of sharp peaks at eigenfrequencies ωdk of the dynamical matrix. In contrast, hypocoordinated solids (HCS) occur above and below jamming and possess fluctuating networks of interparticle contacts but do not undergo cage-breaking particle rearrangements. The density of vibrational frequencies for the HCS is not a collection of sharp peaks at ωdk, but it does possess a common form over a range of Δϕ and T0.},

abstract="During detachment of a viscous fluid extruded from a nozzle, a filament linking the droplet to the latter is formed. Under the effect of surface tension, the filament thins until pinch-off and final detachment of the droplet. In this paper, we study the effect of the presence of individual particles trapped in the filament on the detachment dynamics using granular suspensions of small volume fractions (ϕ{\thinspace}<{\thinspace}6 {\%}). We show that even a single particle strongly modifies the detachment dynamics. The particle perturbs the thinning of the thread, and a large droplet of fluid around the particle is formed. This perturbation leads to an acceleration of the detachment of the droplet compared to the detachment observed for a pure fluid. We quantify this acceleration for single particles of different sizes and link it to similar observations for suspensions of small volume fractions. Our study also gives more insight into particulate effects on detachment of denser suspensions and allows to explain the accelerated detachment close to final pinch-off observed previously (Bonnoit et al. Phys Fluids 24(4):043304, 2012).",

abstract = {We experimentally study the detachment of drops of granular suspensions using a density matched model suspension with varying grain volume fraction (ϕ = 15% to 55%) and grain diameter (d = 20 μm to 140 μm). We show that at the beginning of the detachment process, the suspensions behave as an effective fluid. The detachment dynamics in this regime can be entirely described by the shear viscosity of the suspension [R. J. Furbank and J. F. Morris, Int. J. Multiphase Flow 33(4), 448–468 (2007)]. At later stages of the detachment, the dynamics become independent of the volume fraction and are found to be identical to the dynamics of the interstitial fluid. Surprisingly, visual observation reveals that at this stage, particles are still present in the neck. We suspect rearrangements of particles to locally free the neck of grains, causing the observed dynamics. Close to the final pinch off, the detachment of the suspensions is further accelerated, compared to the dynamics of pure interstitial fluid. This acceleration might be due to the fact that the neck diameter gets of the order of magnitude of the size of the grains and a continuous thinning of the liquid thread is not possible any more. The crossover between the different detachment regimes is a function of the grain size and the initial volume fraction. We characterize the overall acceleration as a function of the grain size and volume fraction.

We have shown previously that the detachment of drops of granular suspensions takes place via different regimes (Bonnoit et al. submitted, 2011). Here we study the influence of the volume fraction of particles on the formation and shape of the droplets by means of visual observations. We measure the minimal neck diameter as well as the height of the detachment as a function of time to quantify the evolution of the drop shape. We also address the question of the thinning dynamics of the neck in the different regimes. Linking the dynamics to the properties of the effective fluid or to rearrangements of individual grains in the thread gives insights in the origin of the different regimes.",

  abstract = {Many jammed particulate systems, such as granular and colloidal materials, interact via repulsive contact forces. We find that these systems possess no harmonic regime in the large system limit ($N \to \infty$) for all compressions $\Delta \phi$ studied, and at jamming onset $\Delta \phi \to 0$ for all $N$. We perform fixed energy simulations following perturbations with amplitude $\delta$ along eigendirections of the dynamical matrix. The fluctuations abruptly spread to all modes for $\delta \approx \delta_c$ (where a single contact breaks) in contrast to linear and weakly nonlinear behavior. For $\delta>\delta_c$, all discrete modes disappear into a continuous frequency band. $\langle \delta_c \rangle scales with 1/N and $\Delta \phi$, which limits harmonic behavior to only overcompressed systems. The density of vibrational modes deviates strongly from that predicted from the dynamical matrix when the system enters the nonharmonic regime, which significantly affects its mechanical and transport properties.},
