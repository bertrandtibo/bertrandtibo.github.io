In this paper, we develop a convolutional neural network to detect and classify nematic defects in confluent cell layers, which we test on both numerical and experimental data!

We are very happy to announce that Henry’s latest work was published today in <a href="https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.131.258301">Physical Review Letters</a>. In this paper, we study entropy production in the most generic mixture of conserved phase fields with nonreciprocal couplings and additive conservative noise. In the special case of the Non-Reciprocal Cahn Hilliard model, we observe a nontrivial scaling of the entropy production rate across a parity-time symmetry breaking phase transition for which we derive an exact expression! <img class="emoji" title=":muscle:" alt=":muscle:" src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f4aa.png" height="20" width="20">

Phys. A publishes the paper we contributed to the Emerging Talents 2021 collection. If you are interested in reading about the nonequilibrium thermodynamics of diffusion in fluctuating potentials, you can find the full text <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1751-8121/ac726b">here</a>. In this paper, we derive general results for the average rate of entropy production of a Brownian particle in a fluctuating potential, including exact results for harmonic confining potentials. Our results give a new perspective on the thermodynamics of stochastic resetting processes and the thermodynamics of optical traps but we believe that it lays the foundations to study the non-equilibirum thermodynamics properties of fluctuating interactions in living systems!

Check out our Letter published today in <a href="https://journals.aps.org/prresearch/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevResearch.4.L022046">Phys. Rev. Research</a>. In this paper, we unify these diverse phase transitions and phase coexistences into a single formulation based on generic hydrodynamic equations for active fluids. In doing so, we also reveal a novel comoving coexistence phase and a multicritical point.

              How can a collection of motile cells, each generating contractile nematic stresses in isolation, become an extensile nematic at the tissue level? We answer this question in our paper published today in <a href="https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.128.078001">PRL</a>! Our results are described in the following <a href="https://physics.aps.org/articles/v15/s21">Synopsis in Physics</a>.

              Welcome to Eleanor and Filip who are joining us for their final-year MSci project. Eleanor will be studying the dynamics of active polymers in crowded environments, while Filip will be employing machine learning techniques to study ecological time series. Lots of new exciting science coming our way!

              Congratulations to Urte and Deepti who graduate with their MSc in Applied Mathematics after some fantastic research projects! Stay tuned… Urte is now moving onto a PhD with the <a href="https://www.kcl.ac.uk/research/disordered-systems"> Disordered Systems group</a> in the Department of Mathematics at King’s College London. Deepti is joining the <a href="https://physics.mit.edu/">Physics department at MIT</a> as a PhD student.

              Today, we are excited to welcome to the group our new cohort of summer students. Su will be studying the effect of stochasticity on travelling wave propagation in a simple model of population growth. Callum, Dana and Jonathan will be looking the interplay between phase separation and collective motion in assemblies of self-propelled ellipsoids. And last but not least, we are very happy to welcome Eloise Lardet who joins us from the University of Edinburgh as part of the fantastic <a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/mathematics/postgraduate/the-mary-lister-mccammon-summer-research-fellowship/">Mary Lister McCammon Summer Research Fellowship</a>  programme. Congratulations to her! With us, she will be looking at pattern formation in tissues and its link to motility induced phase separation. Lots of exciting science in view!

              Following our earlier works on the plasticity of emulsions subject to depletion attraction, in our <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1039/D1SM00097G">latest paper</a> we use functionalized emulsions as a model for cellular tissues and study the dynamics and mechanical response of this biomimetic system under flow. We show that adhesion acts as a trigger of droplet polarization shedding some light on the origin of polarization processes during morphogenesis.
