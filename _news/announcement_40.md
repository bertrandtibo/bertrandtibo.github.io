In 2021, Thibault was selected by the editorial board of the <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/journal/1751-8121">Journal of Physics A</a> as an one of their <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/journal/1751-8121/page/emerging-talents-2021">Emerging Talents</a>:exclamation: Today, J. Phys. A publishes the paper we contributed to the Emerging Talents 2021 collection. If you are interested in reading about the nonequilibrium thermodynamics of diffusion in fluctuating potentials, you can find the full text <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1751-8121/ac726b">here</a>. In this paper, we derive general results for the average rate of entropy production of a Brownian particle in a fluctuating potential, including exact results for harmonic confining potentials. Our results give a new perspective on the thermodynamics of stochastic resetting processes and the thermodynamics of optical traps but we believe that it lays the foundations to study the non-equilibirum thermodynamics properties of fluctuating interactions in living systems!
