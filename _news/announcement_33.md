Today, we are excited to welcome to the group our new cohort of summer students. Su will be studying the effect of stochasticity on travelling wave propagation in a simple model of population growth. Callum, Dana and Jonathan will be looking the interplay between phase separation and collective motion in assemblies of self-propelled ellipsoids. And last but not least, we are very happy to welcome Eloise Lardet who joins us from the University of Edinburgh as part of the fantastic <a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/mathematics/postgraduate/the-mary-lister-mccammon-summer-research-fellowship/">Mary Lister McCammon Summer Research Fellowship</a>  programme. Congratulations to her! With us, she will be looking at pattern formation in tissues and its link to motility induced phase separation. Lots of exciting science in view!
