Fantastic news, Andy's last PhD paper was just published in <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2667074724000016?via%3Dihub">Biophysical Reports</a>. In this paper, we develop a convolutional neural network to detect and classify nematic defects in confluent cell layers, which we test on both numerical and experimental data!
