Our research on the structure of birds nests was featured on the Yale SEAS website: <a href="http://seas.yale.edu/news-events/news/explaining-birds-and-building-blocks">Explaining the Birds and the building blocks of nests</a>, this is in relation with the discussion on nest construction on “Animal Homes,” a three-part documentary series that explores the complexity and diversity of animal architecture; the first program, <a href="http://www.pbs.org/wnet/nature/animal-homes-the-nest-full-episode/11868/">The Nest</a> — which features O’Hern discussing the impressive mechanical properties of birds’ nests — aired on PBS on April, 8th.
