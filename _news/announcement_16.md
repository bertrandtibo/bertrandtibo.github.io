During the summer of 2016, Thibault Bertrand and co-instructor Larry Wilen taught a week long workshop on musical acoustics and instrument design to a group of Pathways Summer Scholars – high school students in Yale’s Pathways to Science program. Pathways to Science is a great coordinated STEM outreach initiative for local pre-college students.
