Following our earlier works on the plasticity of emulsions subject to depletion attraction, in our <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1039/D1SM00097G">latest paper</a> we use functionalized emulsions as a model for cellular tissues and study the dynamics and mechanical response of this biomimetic system under flow. We show that adhesion acts as a trigger of droplet polarization shedding some light on the origin of polarization processes during morphogenesis.
