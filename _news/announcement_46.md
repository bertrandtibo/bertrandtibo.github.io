Today, the lab welcomes two new lab members!  Caetano joins us for his final year MSci project co-supervised by Henry. Eloise returns to us as a PhD student, funded by a President's PhD Scholarship, after having finished her MMath at the University of Edinburgh. Some great science coming from these two very soon! :muscle:
