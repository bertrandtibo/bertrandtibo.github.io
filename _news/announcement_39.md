Intrigued by phase transitions and phase separation in active polar fluids? Check out our Letter published today in <a href="https://journals.aps.org/prresearch/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevResearch.4.L022046">Phys. Rev. Research</a>. In this paper, we unify these diverse phase transitions and phase coexistences into a single formulation based on generic hydrodynamic equations for active fluids. In doing so, we also reveal a novel comoving coexistence phase and a multicritical point.
