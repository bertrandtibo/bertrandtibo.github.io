How can a collection of motile cells, each generating contractile nematic stresses in isolation, become an extensile nematic at the tissue level? We answer this question in our paper published today in <a href="https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.128.078001">PRL</a>! Our results are described in the following <a href="https://physics.aps.org/articles/v15/s21">Synopsis in Physics</a>. We thank the editors for selecting our paper as an Editor's Suggestion.
