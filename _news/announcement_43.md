Our latest <a href="https://journals.aps.org/pre/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevE.106.034603">paper</a> on non-equilibrium phase separation in a model of scalar active matter is out today in Phys. Rev. E! Congrats to Henry who led the study. In this paper, we capture type-IV pili-mediated interactions in  bacteria in a microscopic model then coarse-grain the dynamics formally, describing large scale clustering using non-equilibrium phase separation field theories (Active Model B+)!
