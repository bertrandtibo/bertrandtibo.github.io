In October 2016, Prof. Corey O’Hern and Dr. Thibault Bertrand gave a public lecture on the <a href="https://seas.yale.edu/news-events/news/ohern-and-bertrand-explain-mysteries-sand-video" > Mysteries of Sand</a>. Using water pitchers, hourglasses, glass pebbles, coffee beans and other props, O’Hern and Bertrand demonstrated the interesting properties of non-thermal granular media (such as sand and powder) to a crowd of elementary and junior high school students during this talk sponsored by Yale’s CRISP and Pathways to Science.
