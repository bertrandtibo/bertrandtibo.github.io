Very happy to see this neat paper published in <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ece3.10295">Ecology and Evolution</a>, fruit of a great collaboration with Dr Loïc Marrec and Claudia Bank at the Institut für Ökologie und Evolution from the Universität Bern! We show that using a deterministic equation to describe stochastic population growth may not be a good idea! 😱 In addition to explaining why 🧐, we solve the stochastic dynamics! 😇
