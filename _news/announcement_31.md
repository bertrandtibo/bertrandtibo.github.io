We are excited to welcome two new members of the group. Urte and Deepti are joining us for their MSc project. Urte will be studying the phase transitions in opinion formation in the presence of leaders and extremists groups, while Deepti will be studying the dynamics of paramecia. Lots of new exciting science coming our way!
