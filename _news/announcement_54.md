Another study hot off the press! In a paper published today in <a href="https://journals.aps.org/prresearch/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevResearch.5.043032">Phys. Rev. Research</a> led by <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=XK7kc6kAAAAJ&hl=en">Luca Cocconi</a>, we show that reciprocity-breaking fluctuations about a reciprocal mean coupling are sufficient to drive persistent motion reminiscent of self-propulsion in active bound states.
