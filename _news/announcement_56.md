Right in time for Christmas :christmas_tree:! We are very happy to announce that Henry's latest work was published today in <a href="https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.131.258301">Physical Review Letters</a>. In this paper, we study entropy production in the most generic mixture of conserved phase fields with nonreciprocal couplings and additive conservative noise. In the special case of the Non-Reciprocal Cahn Hilliard model, we observe a nontrivial scaling of the entropy production rate across a parity-time symmetry breaking phase transition for which we derive an exact expression! :muscle:
