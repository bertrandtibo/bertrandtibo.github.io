As the new year starts, we welcome some more new faces (full house this year!): Jane returns after her summer fellowship as an MSc student in Applied Mathematics. Hailing from the MSc in Applied Mathematics as well, Tamsin joins us for a project in collaboration with <a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/b.walter">Dr Benjamin Walter</a>.
