<h4>Shalabh Kumar Anand, PhD</h4>

<p>Postdoctoral research associate (co-supervised with <a href="http://www.bg.ic.ac.uk/research/c.lee/index.html">Dr Chiu Fan Lee</a>)</p>

<p align="justify">Shalabh is a Postdoctoral Research Assistant working at Imperial College with Dr. Thibault Bertrand (Department of Mathematics) and Dr. Chiu Fan Lee (Department of Bioengineering). His research interests lie in soft matter, mainly in active matter systems. His current focus is to explore dense systems of active particles and ask the question of the existence of jammed states and universality in living or synthetic non-equilibrium systems. He previously worked on simulations of active polymers and anisotropic microswimmers under confinement. He obtained his PhD in Physics from Indian Institute of Science Education and Research Bhopal, India.

<h4>Filip Weidler</h4>

<p>MSci student in Mathematics</p>

<p align="justify">Filip is a fourth year student on the Msci Mathematics program at Imperial taking mostly physics and computational mathematics modules this year after focusing on statistics in the previous years. In the group, his project deals with the analysis of ecological data of a marine ecosystem; in particular, Filip is trying to determine causality relations between population time series through the use of Echo State Networks. His goal is to find a method robust to the effects of noise and seasonality on short time series data.

<h4>Deepti Kannan</h4>

<p>MSc student in Applied Mathematics</p>

<p align="justify"> Deepti is a MSc student in Applied Mathematics at Imperial and a Marshall scholar from California, USA. Previously, she completed an MPhil in the David Wales lab at the University of Cambridge and a bachelors in Engineering Physics at Stanford, where she developed an analytical model of chromatin organization in the lab of Andrew J. Spakowitz. Her current research focuses on modeling the non-equilibrium dynamics of paramecia, a unicellular organism that exhibits mechanosensitive behavior. When she isn't running simulations of active Brownian particles, she enjoys running along the Thames, singing Evensong, and cooking vegan delicacies.
