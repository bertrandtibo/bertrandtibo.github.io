* In October 2016, Prof. Corey O’Hern and Dr. Thibault Bertrand gave a public lecture on the <a href="https://seas.yale.edu/news-events/news/ohern-and-bertrand-explain-mysteries-sand-video" > Mysteries of Sand</a>. Using water pitchers, hourglasses, glass pebbles, coffee beans and other props, O’Hern and Bertrand demonstrated the interesting properties of non-thermal granular media (such as sand and powder) to a crowd of elementary and junior high school students during this talk sponsored by Yale’s CRISP and Pathways to Science.

* During the summer of 2016, Thibault Bertrand and co-instructor Larry Wilen taught a week long workshop on musical acoustics and instrument design to a group of Pathways Summer Scholars – high school students in Yale’s Pathways to Science program. Pathways to Science is a great coordinated STEM outreach initiative for local pre-college students. You can read about this initiative here: <a href="https://seas.yale.edu/news-events/news/ceid-local-high-school-students-learn-music-engineering"> At CEID, Local high school students learn the music of engineering </a>.

* The Connecticut Public Radio (WNPR) released a great piece about our class <strong>ENAS344/MUSI371 Musical Acoustics & Instrument Design</strong>. You can listen to it here :  <a href="https://www.wnpr.org/post/yale-lab-experimentation-and-engineering-intersect-musical-composition#stream/0"> At Yale Lab, Experimentation and Engineering Intersect with Musical Composition</a>

* Thibault Bertrand was awarded the 2016 Harding Bliss Prize, “to a graduating PhD student who has done the most to further the intellectual life of the School of Engineering & Applied Science.” Read more about it here : <a href="https://seas.yale.edu/news-events/news/graduate-students-honored-annual-crest-fest">Graduate Students Honored at Annual Crest and Fest</a>
