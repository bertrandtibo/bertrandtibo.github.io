<h4><strong> PDEs in Action: Introduction to modelling in applied mathematics, MATH50008 </strong></h4>
<p><i>Spring 2021</i></p>

<p align="justify"> This module provides a hands-on introduction to partial differential equations and the concept of modelling in applied mathematics. We focus on the practical applications of partial differential equations. Along the way, students are introduced to classical partial differential equations and as well as more advanced examples. Throughout the course, the students learn basic techniques of resolutions of PDEs. Students are also introduced to basic numerical methods to solve partial differential equations.</p>

<h4><strong> Theory of Complex Systems, MATH96004 </strong></h4>
<p><i>Spring 2020</i></p>

<p align="justify">Complex systems are systems composed of many components or agents which interact with one another. One finds examples of complex systems at all scales; these include systems as varied as biological organisms (from the single cell to the whole organism), financial markets, ecosystems, transportation/communication systems or the human brain. The theory of complex systems tries to establish an understanding of the intimate link between the emergent systemic collective behavior and the dynamics of its individual components. In this module, we introduce the theoretical and computational concepts needed to describe the spatial and temporal behaviour of complex systems. We start by introducing the necessary tools from statistical mechanics and the study of phase transitions. We then introduce a variety of examples including  models of percolation, self-organized criticality (sandpile and forest fire models), out-of-equilibrium dynamics (Langevin and Fokker-Planck formulations), models of interacting agents on lattices and networks (e.g. Schelling model, Kuramoto model). Finally, we look beyond conserved interacting agents and discuss reaction-diffusion processes and evolutionary dynamics.</p>


<h4><strong> Introduction to University Mathematics, MATH40001 </strong></h4>
<p><i>Fall 2019, Fall 2020</i></p>

<p align="justify">This module provides a transition towards the way ones thinks about, and does, Mathematics at university. It stresses the importance of precise definitions and rigorous proofs, but also discuss their relationship to more informal styles of reasoning which are often encountered in applications of Mathematics. Topics covered include an introduction to elementary set theory, common proof strategies as well as common functions, and elementary vector operations and geometry.</p>
