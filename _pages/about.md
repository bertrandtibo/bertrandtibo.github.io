**Welcome to the Bertrand Lab @ Imperial!**

We are based in the department of mathematics at Imperial College London. Employing analytical and computational tools from non-equilibrium statistical mechanics, soft condensed matter physics and stochastic processes, our work finds applications in the physical, life and social sciences. Our research group is particularly interested in studying the stochastic dynamics of living and reactive systems. With the aim of shining some light on complex biological processes and discovering novel physical principles, our research combines the development of new analytical methods and the modeling of real systems, from the single agent scale (e.g., via random walk theory) to the level of collective and emergent behaviours in out-of-equilibrium and disordered systems (including for instance in tissue dynamics).
