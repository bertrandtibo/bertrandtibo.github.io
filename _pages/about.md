Welcome to the Bertrand Lab @ Imperial! 

Our research group is interested in understanding collective and emergent behaviours in out-of-equilibrium and disordered systems. Employing analytical and computational tools from non-equilibrium statistical mechanics, soft condensed matter physics and stochastic processes, our work finds applications in the physical, life and social sciences.
